1.Removing the stop words

>Tokenizing the sentence and making a function to skip all the stop words in a sentence or a data series

2.Lemmatize the data

>Converting the words from plural to singular.

3.Stemming the data.

> Converting the words into their root form.

4. Removing the number from the data.

>To have better columns when we vectorize

5. Lower casing the words.

>This is optional, genrally this is done so that "WORDS" and "words" are same words!!!.

#Vectorization

I have also performed the vectorization on my dataset, in this case I have used the count vectors.

#Clustering

After the vectorization I have divided my data in a number of clusters using K-means clustering. This was just the demonstrate how vectors and cluster work together.
